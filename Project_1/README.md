## Introduction
According to a recent study conducted by a leading business research firm, profitability modeling has shown remarkable results. The study found that companies that implemented effective profitability modeling strategies experienced an average increase in their profitability by 20% within the first year of implementation. Join me as I help a friend with their Ebay Cat Toy Business

## The Problem
A friend came to me asking for help to build a tool to calculate the profitability of a product that they want to sell on eBay. The product is a new type of interactive cat toy. 

### The Solution
I want to help her out as much as possible so Iâ€™ll be using the highly effective profitability modeling technique to create a profitability modeling tool, that way my friend  will be able to input different scenarios and variables, allowing for dynamic analysis and accurate projections. They can experiment with different pricing strategies, shipping options, and marketing approaches to optimize profitability.  This will empower my friend to make informed decisions and adapt their selling strategy accordingly. Rest assured, I will ensure that the profitability modeling tool is user-friendly and intuitive, enabling my friend to easily navigate and interpret the results. Regular updates and refinements can be made to the tool as needed, ensuring its effectiveness in assisting my friend's e-commerce venture on eBay.

## Data Analysis Techniques
The data analysis techniques I employed to calculate profitability:
1. Establish baselines
2. Define input parameters
3. Perform what-if testing to assess the impact of different scenarios on profitability
4. Data visualization to visualize the comparison of scenarios

### Why?
By analyzing the data using appropriate techniques, this model will uncover patterns, trends, and relationships that may not be immediately apparent. This enables my friend to make more accurate and effective decisions, leading to improved business outcomes for their cat toy business

## Data Collection 
The data collection process first started by gathering the initial business assumptions
Here are the business assumptions: 
- Quantity sold: 50
- Selling price per item: $5.49
- Cost per item: $2.49
- Shipping cost per item: $3.00
- Handling cost per item: $0.18
- One-time advertising cost: $10.00

This is a comprehensive snapshot of the business's current state and shows that the business has not made a profit. The total costs exceeds the total revenue:

## Scenario Analysis
After establishing a baseline and defining the input parameters I wanted to test these scenarios to assess the potential impact on profitability:
 
     1. What if they buy the product in bulk so that the price of the product falls to $2.25 per piece?
     2. What if they increase the advertising budget from $10 to $25 and then expect to sell 15% more in quantity at the same price?
     3. What if they increase the price by 20% and expect to sell 10% fewer products at the new price?

## Results
### Scenario 1

Because we are buying in bulk this reduces the price of the product to $2.25 per piece. This reduces our total costs by 4% and increasing profit by 60%, however we still have not broke even.

### Scenario 2

This scenario increases our total costs by 26%, increases revenue by 20%, however our total profit decreases by 122%

### Scenario 3

This scenario decreases total cost by 10%, increases revenue by 8%, and we finally make a profit.

## Recommendations
After reviewing the analysis results, there is a clear winner.

I recommend implement scenario 3 and increase the price by 20%. Not only do we decrease total cost by 10%, we also increase revenue by 8% and actually make a profit.

We will continue to make updates to this model as well as track the performance of the strategy we will be implementing.
