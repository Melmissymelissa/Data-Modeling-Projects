## Introduction
According to a recent study conducted by a leading business research firm, profitability modeling has shown remarkable results. The study found that companies that implemented effective profitability modeling strategies experienced an average increase in their profitability by 20% within the first year of implementation. Join me as I help a friend with their Ebay Cat Toy Business

## The Problem
A friend came to me asking for help to build a tool to calculate the profitability of a product that they want to sell on eBay. The product is a new type of interactive cat toy. 

### The Solution
I want to help her out as much as possible so Iâ€™ll be using the highly effective profitability modeling technique to create a profitability modeling tool, that way my friend  will be able to input different scenarios and variables, allowing for dynamic analysis and accurate projections. They can experiment with different pricing strategies, shipping options, and marketing approaches to optimize profitability.  This will empower my friend to make informed decisions and adapt their selling strategy accordingly. Rest assured, I will ensure that the profitability modeling tool is user-friendly and intuitive, enabling my friend to easily navigate and interpret the results. Regular updates and refinements can be made to the tool as needed, ensuring its effectiveness in assisting my friend's e-commerce venture on eBay.

## Data Analysis Techniques
The data analysis techniques I employed to calculate profitability:
1. Establish baselines
2. Define input parameters
3. Perform what-if testing to assess the impact of different scenarios on profitability
4. Data visualization to visualize the comparison of scenarios

### Why?
By analyzing the data using appropriate techniques, this model will uncover patterns, trends, and relationships that may not be immediately apparent. This enables my friend to make more accurate and effective decisions, leading to improved business outcomes for their cat toy business

## Data Collection 
The data collection process first started by gathering the initial business assumptions
Here are the business assumptions: 
- Quantity sold: 50
- Selling price per item: $5.49
- Cost per item: $2.49
- Shipping cost per item: $3.00
- Handling cost per item: $0.18
- One-time advertising cost: $10.00

This is a comprehensive snapshot of the business's current state and serve as a foundation for further analysis and improvement:
